Task Scheduler Application:
This is a Node.js-based Task Scheduler application using the Express.js framework. 

Users can plan and manage their daily tasks with much ease in this application. Some of the key features of the project include:

- Interactive User Interface: Users can easily add, view, and manage their tasks for each day.
- Server-Side Logic: Implemented by using Node.js and Express.js for core backend operations and routing.
- No Database Integration: This project, in its current form, does not integrate any database for data management; it either uses in-memory storage or local files.

This project tries to minimize the hassle of task management by giving them a neat, efficient scheduling tool so they can keep track of tasks and stay updated regarding their responsibilities
