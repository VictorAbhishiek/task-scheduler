My name is Talari Victor Abhishek, and I am a fresh postgraduate from Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, in Metallurgical Engineering. I'm so passionate about MERN stack development and eager to get practical, hands-on experience in backend development. This keeps me driven to improve continuously and work on valuable projects.

I am enthusiastic about applying my knowledge in real-life applications and look forward to working with a progressive organization where my skills will be utilized in the way of promoting growth and innovation. My aim is to involve myself in critical projects that provide an opportunity not only to implement technical ability but also for professional growth and to offer value for worthy contribution.

I am open to any opportunity that would give me a chance to be part of a dynamic team, contribute and learn; strengthen my ability through hands-on experience and problem-solving skills.
